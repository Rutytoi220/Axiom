"""Backward-compatible shim.

The color/geometry/typography constants that used to live in this module
(and the ``QGraphicsDropShadowEffect``-based ``apply_glow`` helper) have been
replaced by the dynamic token engine in :mod:`axiom.gui.styles.theme_manager`
— see that module for the ``Theme`` / ``ThemeManager`` / ``ThemeRegistry``
architecture. Widgets should import ``get_theme_manager`` directly rather
than this module; it is kept only so any stray external import of
``axiom.gui.styles.palette`` does not hard-fail.
