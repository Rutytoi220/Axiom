"""Sync-over-async bridge for AXIOM.

Provides a single correct way to call async code from synchronous
contexts.  Uses a dedicated background thread with a persistent
event loop so that aiosqlite connections (which are loop-bound and
thread-bound) work correctly.

Why not ``asyncio.run()``?
    ``asyncio.run()`` raises ``RuntimeError`` when called from inside
    an already-running event loop.

Why not ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` + ``asyncio.run()``?
    aiosqlite connections are pinned to the thread and event loop
    they were created on.  Spawning a fresh loop in a worker thread
    would use a foreign loop, causing ``sqlite3.ProgrammingError``
    or silent data corruption.

This module solves both problems by running a **single** background
event loop on a **single** daemon thread.  All sync callers submit
coroutines to that loop via ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` and block
on the resulting ``Future``.

.. warning::

   ``run_sync()`` must NOT be called from code already executing on
   the bridge loop's thread (i.e. from inside a coroutine that was
   itself submitted via ``run_sync()``).  Doing so would deadlock
   because the loop cannot process the inner coroutine while the
   outer one is still occupying it.  A ``RuntimeError`` is raised
   if this is detected.
