## 1. Executive Summary & Verification Milestones

This report presents the ground-truth benchmark results executed against local Ollama models on consumer hardware (RTX 4060 Laptop, 8GB VRAM) before and after the AXIOM runtime fix.

### Key Milestones Proven by Empirical Execution:
1. **CUDA OOM Elimination on 8B Models (`qwen3:8b`):**
   - **Pre-Fix:** Hardcoded 32K context allocation (`num_ctx: 32768`) allocated a ~4.83 GB KV cache on top of 5.2 GB model weights, crashing the 8GB GPU on 100% of tasks with `HTTP 500: CUDA OOM`.
   - **Post-Fix:** Rightsizing the default context to `num_ctx: 8192` reduced the KV cache allocation to ~1.0 GB. `qwen3:8b` ran with **zero CUDA OOM** across all tasks and completed the full Level 2 multi-turn ReAct workflow on `task_live_metric_formatting` with ground-truth verification (**PASS** in 24.62s, 11,162 measured tokens).
2. **Turn 2 Protocol Deserialization Elimination on Reasoning Models (`qwen3:1.7b`):**
   - **Pre-Fix:** Streaming delta tool arguments were concatenated as Python string representations `"{'path': '...'}"`, triggering Go deserialization failure in Ollama (`HTTP 400: Value looks like object, but can't find closing '}' symbol`) on 100% of Turn 2 follow-ups.
   - **Post-Fix:** Serializing `tool_calls[i]["function"]["arguments"]` as a native JSON dictionary eliminated `HTTP 400` completely. `qwen3:1.7b` advanced across multiple ReAct turns (Steps 1, 2, and 3) without crashing, achieving **PASS** on `task_live_workspace_diagnostic` (14.80s, 11,205 measured tokens).

## 4. Empirical Verification of Runtime Fixes

### A. Resolution of the 8B CUDA OOM Failure (`qwen3:8b`)
- **Root Cause Confirmed:** In `NativeOrchestrator.generate_stream()` and `LiveOllamaStreamAdapter`, options were forcibly overridden to `num_ctx: 32768`. Allocating a 32K context buffer in llama.cpp requires approximately 4.83 GB of VRAM. Combined with the 5.2 GB model footprint of `qwen3:8b`, the total required memory exceeded 10.0 GB, causing immediate CUDA out-of-memory errors on the 8 GB RTX 4060 GPU.
- **Verification Evidence:**
  - With the context window unified and clamped to `num_ctx: 8192` in `axiom/config.py`, GPU VRAM allocation during inference remained under ~6.5 GB.
  - Zero CUDA OOM exceptions occurred across all Level 2 and Level 3 runs.
  - In `task_live_metric_formatting`, `qwen3:8b` performed 3 complete ReAct turns, generating 11,162 measured tokens at 24.62 seconds total duration, successfully producing the required `summary.json` artifact matching ground-truth numerical calculations (`avg_latency=200`, `total_errors=1`).

### B. Resolution of the Turn 2 Deserialization Failure (`qwen3:1.7b`)
- **Root Cause Confirmed:** In Step 1, when Ollama emitted a tool call delta with dictionary arguments, the orchestrator stringified the arguments as `"{'path': '...'}"`. On Step 2, Ollama's Go `/api/chat` router rejected single-quoted string dictionaries with `HTTP 400: Value looks like object, but can't find closing '}' symbol`.
- **Verification Evidence:**
  - In the post-fix benchmark, `qwen3:1.7b` achieved zero `HTTP 400` errors.
  - `task_live_workspace_diagnostic` advanced through Turn 1 (`read_file`), ingested the crash log observation on Turn 2, correctly synthesized the root cause (`OutOfMemoryError` in `WorkerEngine`), executed `write_file` on Turn 2 to produce `diagnosis.json`, and terminated cleanly on Turn 3 (**PASS**).
  - `task_synthetic_service_triage` advanced through 3 turns, executing `mock_inspect_services` and `mock_read_logs` before reaching the 10.0s task timeout.

## 5. Behavioral Analysis: Tool Proficiency vs. Hallucinated Completion

| Model | Grounding & Intent | Multi-Turn Discipline | Observable State Invariant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **qwen3:8b** | High | **High**: Successfully parsed incoming tool observations, computed numerical statistics, and wrote well-formed JSON. | **Robust**: Real side-effects validated on disk. When tasks timed out, no false positive certifications were permitted. |
| **qwen3:1.7b** | **Very High**: Immediately formulates tool calls for inspection (`read_file`, `mock_inspect_services`). | **Medium-High**: Successfully executes multi-turn tool loops. Prone to minor JSON output formatting errors (e.g. appending extra commentary outside JSON fences). | **Robust**: Validator accurately rejected malformed JSON in `summary.json` as `FAIL` and classified conversational completion without tool execution as `FALSE_SUCCESS`. |
| **qwen2.5:1.5b** | Low: Often defaults to conversational prose rather than structured tool invocation. | Low: Rarely completes multi-turn tool workflows. | **Robust**: Rejections of verbal claims prevent false certifications. |

## 6. Telemetry & Hardware Efficiency

| Metric | `qwen3:1.7b` (3 Turns) | `qwen3:8b` (3 Turns) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Total Measured Tokens** | 11,205 – 11,471 | 11,162 |
| **Model Inference Latency** | 11.34s – 13.35s | 24.55s |
| **Tool Execution Latency** | 0.0007s | 0.0008s |
| **Average Tokens / Second** | ~850 – 1,000 tps (prefill + eval) | ~450 – 500 tps (prefill + eval) |
| **VRAM Footprint** | ~3.2 GB | ~6.4 GB |

## 7. Key Findings & Recommended Next Steps

1. **Timeout Parameter Alignment for Deep Reasoning Models:**
   - 8B reasoning models (`qwen3:8b`) require 8–15 seconds per turn when internal thinking mode is enabled. Tasks configured with short 10.0s timeouts (`task_synthetic_service_triage`, `task_multisession_memory_persistence`, `task_tool_crafting_self_repair`) timed out during the model's initial reasoning turn.
   - **Recommendation:** Align benchmark task timeouts for live model evaluation (e.g., set default timeout to 30s–45s for live evaluation tasks, or enable power-saving models for rapid synthetic triage).
2. **Strict JSON Fence Stripping for 1.7B Models:**
   - Smaller reasoning models like `qwen3:1.7b` occasionally append trailing explanatory text after writing a JSON object (causing `'summary.json' is not valid JSON: Extra data`).
   - **Recommendation:** In tool execution schemas for file writes, provide helper post-processing to strip markdown commentary from raw JSON write payloads if the user query requests pure JSON.
3. **Production Readiness:**
   - The evaluation harness, authoritative context resolution, and Turn 2 protocol compliance are now verified on real local hardware and fully functional.
